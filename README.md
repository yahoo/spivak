> A toolkit for automatic analysis of sports videos.

## Background

This package implements methods for action spotting and camera
shot segmentation on the
[SoccerNet dataset](https://www.soccer-net.org/). In addition,
it provides a set of tools for visualizing results, and for
visualizing various metrics that are computed against the ground
truth annotations.

Most of the code in this repository deals with implementing the
following two papers, which focus on the task of action spotting
on the SoccerNet dataset.
- [Temporally Precise Action Spotting in Soccer Videos Using
Dense Detection Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10450).
In ICIP, 2022.
- [Action Spotting using Dense Detection Anchors Revisited:
Submission to the SoccerNet Challenge 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07846).
arXiv preprint, 2022.

The action spotting method that is implemented here
came in first place in the SoccerNet Challenge 2022. You can
read more about the 2022 challenge and results in the following paper:
- [SoccerNet 2022 Challenges Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02365).
In MMSports, 2022.

## Setup

### Requirements

Our models depend on TensorFlow, though this package also includes
evaluation and visualization code that does not. We've currently
only tested our code using TensorFlow 2.3.0, which is thus currently
specified in the [setup.py](setup.py) file. Some visualization
scripts depend on ffmpeg via PyAV (`av` pip package). The rest of
the dependencies are specified in [setup.py](setup.py) and can
likely be directly installed using pip as above.

For the heavier sets of features, our standard flow assumes that a good
amount of CPU RAM is available. We recommend having 256GB or more
in order to make things simpler. Our input data pipeline is
responsible for consuming most of the CPU memory and can be tweaked to
consume less at the cost of speed. An example of how to do this is
presented in
[one of our guides](Reproducing-results-from-the-SoccerNet-action-spotting-challenge-2022.md#low-memory-configuration).
The code implementing the input data pipeline is in
[tf_dataset.py](spivak/models/tf_dataset.py), and is based on
[tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data).

### Install

If you do not have `ffmpeg` installed, please edit [setup.py](setup.py)
and comment out the line with `av`. Then, run pip install in order
to do a local development install, as follows. After successful installation,
you should see the message `Successfully installed spivak`.

```bash
BASE_CODE_DIR="YOUR_BASE_CODE_DIR"  # Wherever the spivak repo is located.
cd $BASE_CODE_DIR/spivak  # The root folder, which contains setup.py.
pip install -e .
```

### Get the SoccerNet data

You will most likely want to download the following set of
precomputed features and labels using SoccerNet's pip package.
Please see detailed instructions at <https://www.soccer-net.org/data>.
- ResNet features
(filenames used for downloading: `["1_ResNET_TF2.npy", "2_ResNET_TF2.npy"]`).
- ResNet features projected using PCA
(filenames used for downloading: `["1_ResNET_TF2_PCA512.npy", "2_ResNET_TF2_PCA512.npy"]`).
- Baidu features
(these were also denoted _Combination_ in our papers; filenames
used for downloading:
`["1_baidu_soccer_embeddings.npy", "2_baidu_soccer_embeddings.npy"]`).
- Action spotting labels
(filename used for downloading: `["Labels-v2.json"]`).
- Camera shot segmentation labels
(filename used for downloading: `["Labels-cameras.json"]`).

If you would like to use our video-specific visualization functionality,
you will also need to get the
[SoccerNet videos](https://www.soccer-net.org/data#h.ov9k48lcih5g).
The low-resolution version of the videos should be enough for
visualization purposes.

### Optionally, set up some convenient folders

In order to make it easier to follow our guides, we suggest that you create some
folders to store your models and results, as follows.

```bash
MODELS_DIR="YOUR_MODELS_DIR"
mkdir -p $MODELS_DIR
RESULTS_DIR="YOUR_RESULTS_DIR"
mkdir -p $RESULTS_DIR
REPORTS_DIR="YOUR_REPORTS_DIR"
mkdir -p $REPORTS_DIR
VISUALIZATIONS_DIR="YOUR_VISUALIZATIONS_DIR"
mkdir -p $VISUALIZATIONS_DIR
# We recommend setting FEATURES_DIR to "data/features" as below, since many
# commands in our guides use "data/features" directly.
FEATURES_DIR="data/features"
mkdir -p $FEATURES_DIR
```

We also recommend that you create the symbolic links described below, so
that you can easily access the downloaded SoccerNet data. The symbolic links
will point from the [data/](data) folder to the folders containing the actual
downloaded data.

```bash
cd data/  # This folder will initially just contain the splits/ folder.
ln -s YOUR_LABELS_FOLDER  labels  # For the Labels-v2.json and/or the Labels-cameras.json files.
ln -s YOUR_FEATURES_RESNET_FOLDER  features/resnet  # For the ResNet-based features.
ln -s YOUR_FEATURES_BAIDU_FOLDER  features/baidu  # For the Baidu Combination features.
ln -s YOUR_VIDEOS_224P_FOLDER  videos_224p  # For the low-resolution videos.
```

## Action spotting usage

Please see [Action-spotting-usage.md](Action-spotting-usage.md).

## Camera shot segmentation usage

Stay tuned! Instructions for running the camera shot segmentation code should be coming soon.
